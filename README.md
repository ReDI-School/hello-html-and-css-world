# Hello HTML and CSS world

This repo contains a set of html and css files for practicing html and
css basics.

To work on it, ask your teacher to add your GitHub account. Then you
can clone it with

    git clone https://github.com/ReDI-School/hello-html-and-css-world.git

This creates a new directory `hello-html-and-css-world` with all the
files of this repository. `cd` into it, then start editing.

You can preview the contents locally by opening the `index.html` file
with your web browser (how depends on the browser, one way is Menu ->
File -> Open).

To push your changes, create a commit:

    git add .
    git commit -m "..."

then push it to GitHub

    git push

and make sure there were no errors. If someone else pushed their changes in the meantime, you might need to

    git pull

first.

The latest version is online at
https://redi-school.github.io/hello-html-and-css-world/ (it can take a
minute to update).
